# Common flags list: 
 -v verbose
 -vv very verbose
 -u specifies a single user
 -U specifies a list of users in a file 
 --pass specifies a single password
 -P specifies a list of password in a file 
 -f stops after the first valid found credentials
 -T [0~5] specifies how aggressive the bruteforce will be: 0 (paranoid), 5 (insane) # 0 and 1 are for IDS evasion
 -d enables debugging, it is a more powerful verbose
 -sL lists only hosts and services
 -iL specifies a list of hosts 
 -iX specifies as input the nmap output XML file obtained with nmap -oX
 -iN specifies as input the nmap output normal file obtained with nmap -oN
 -oA outputs the results of ncrack

# Search /ServicesTable/ in man page to list supported services

# Common fine-tuning bruteforce options:
 cl (min connection limit) - minimum number of concurrent parallel connections
 CL (max connection limit) - maximum number of concurrent parallel connections
 at (authentication tries) - authentication attempts per connection
 cd (connection delay) - delay time between each connection initiation
 cr (connection retries) - caps number of service connection attempts
 to (time-out) - maximum cracking time for service, regardless of success so far

# Common in-running commands
 v increase verbosity level
 V decrease verbosity level
 d increase debugging level
 D decrease debugging level
 p / P display found credentials
 ? print a runtime interaction help screen

# FTP bruteforce, stops after the first successful login
# by default ncrack uses two default files for users and pwds
# default.usr and default.pwd
ncrack -f ftp://192.168.0.105

# SSH bruteforce attempt on port 5910
ncrack ssh://192.168.1.1:5910

# Bruteforce multiple hosts/services
ncrack scanme.nmap.org:22 ftp://10.0.0.10 ssh://192.168.1.*:5910

# Bruteforce with password "admin123" and a users list
ncrack -U users.txt --pass admin123 10.10.10.10:21

# Bruteforce with users and passwords list. The XML is an nmap input, ncrack will follow it
ncrack -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -iX nmap.xml

# Aggressive bruteforce, with user "test" and a passwords list
ncrack -u test -P 500-worst-passwords.txt -T 5 -p 21 10.10.10.10

# RDP bruteforce attempt on port 3389, with user "administrator" and a passwords list
ncrack -u administrator -P 500-worst-passwords.txt -p 3389 10.212.50.21

# Very verbose bruteforce with users, passwords and host lists, outputs the results
ncrack -vv -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -iL host.txt -oA output_ncrack

# Very verbose bruteforce with users and passwords list, max number of connections set to 1
ncrack -vv -U users.txt -P rockyou.txt 192.168.56.10:3389,CL=1

# Bruteforce all specified hosts and the subnet of 192.168.2.0/24 against SSH (22) FTP (3210) and Telnet (23)

# Bruteforce scanme.nmap.org on port 22, host 10.0.0.10 on FTP (21), 192.168.1.0/24 hosts on SSH (5910)
ncrack scanme.nmap.org:22 ftp://10.0.0.10 ssh://192.168.1.*:5910

# Bruteforce options, applied only to FTP service with "-m" flag
